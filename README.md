# Project Guess-Who (Week 5)

Had to build a functioning guess-who game through the understandings of arrays, functions, filters, and object management in javascript. Thus allowing us to 'guess' who the secret person was of the game.

## The problem

The first big problem I came across was getting the 'Find Out' button to function properly. It could be clicked but nothing would happen after. I needed to better define my variable for value as well as my values for my alerts to properly function. I solved it partly from an eyeball from my team and partly from looking and breaking down others code. I also had trouble with win or lose function not displaying properly. I realized I needed to reverse my style displays for the board both in the checkMyGuess function and the start function. Otherwise all the cards would be turned off from the previous game when restarted.
