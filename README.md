# Project Guess-Who (Week 5)

Had to build a functioning guess-who game through the understandings of arrays, functions, filters, and object management in javascript. Thus allowing us to 'guess' who the secret person was of the game.

## The problem
Javascript is still really difficult for me to understand. I'm not sure if I really understand what I did do in this project...

The first big problem I came across was getting the 'Find Out' button to function properly. It could be clicked but nothing would happen after. I needed to better define my variable for value as well as my values for my alerts to properly function. I solved it partly from an eyeball from my team and partly from looking and breaking down others code. I also had trouble with win or lose function not displaying properly. I realized I needed to reverse my style displays for the board both in the checkMyGuess function and the start function. Otherwise all the cards would be turned off from the previous game when restarted. 

If I had more time I would like to have started over on this from the beginning to see if I understood it better. I wish I could style it in a more fun and interesting way but I decided to focus on just getting it to function properly.
